    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> The three friends, George, Harris and J (Jerome) agree that they need a change in their boring lives. Harris suggests a vacation that will get them moving. They decide to take a trip on the River Thames to improve their health, find some lost energy and take a break from their work. They take Jerome's dog, Montmorency, along for the ten-day trip. </p>

      <p>The story begins with the three friends planning and preparing for the journey. They pack only the things they need and set off for the River Thames on a rented boat. Their journey begins in Kingston, heading for Oxford.
</p> 

      <p>As they are all very impractical, most of all George, they are not used to look after themselves, so they have to face several challenges and embarrassments during the journey. Besides the challenges, the three friends also encounter some very strange incidents along the way, such as being attacked by aggressive swans and discovering a woman's body floating in the river. They sometimes regret going on the trip, but in the end they continue to enjoy it and continue their journey. With typical English humour, they get through all the traps and situations. 
</p>
      
      <p>When the weather turns bad, the three friends are forced to leave the ship, arrive in Oxford four days early by train and spend the last day of the trip in a pub. They enjoy a delicious meal and reflect on their journey down the river. They return to their boring and quiet lives.</p>
